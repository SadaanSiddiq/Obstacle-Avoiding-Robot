# Obstacle-Avoiding-Robot
Obstacle Avoiding Robot is an Arduino-based autonomous robot that uses an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to detect obstacles in its path and automatically avoid collisions. The car continuously measures distance in front of it and decides whether to move forward or turn to avoid hitting objects.
